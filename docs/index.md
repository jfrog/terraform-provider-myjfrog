# JFrog MyJFrog Provider

The [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) MyJFrog provider is used to interact with the features from [MyJFrog portal](https://my.jfrog.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Links to documentation for specific resources can be found in the table of contents to the left.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    myjfrog = {
      source  = "jfrog/myjfrog"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "myjfrog" {
  // supply JFROG_MYJFROG_API_TOKEN as env var
}

resource "myjfrog_ip_allowlist" "myjfrog-ip-allowlist" {
  server_name = "my-jpd-server-name"
  ips = [
    "1.1.1.7/1",
    "2.2.2.7/1",
  ]
}
```

## Authentication

The JFrog MyJFrog provider supports API token for authentication.

### API Token

MyJFrog API tokens may be used via the HTTP Authorization header by providing the `api_token` field to the provider block. Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `JFROG_MYJFROG_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

Usage:
```terraform
provider "myjfrog" {
  api_token = "abc...xy"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_token` (String, Sensitive) API token that allows you to make changes to your MyJFrog account. See [Generate a Token in MyJFrog](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-hosting-models-documentation/generate-a-token-in-myjfrog) for more details. This can also be sourced from the `JFROG_MYJFROG_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
